                <h1>Group Project</h1>
                <p>For this semester’s group project, we must do a website to convince student 
                to join media. We must include stuff from all subjects we take. I don’t really 
                like the idea of the whole project as it doesn’t show our full potential in our 
                research skills, and it is so limited but we have to do it in order to pass this 
                semester. What makes it even harder is even working in a group. Working in a group 
                is a bit tough as you work with different mentalities, and everyone wants his 
                idea to be implemented or sometimes it’s just tough to deal with a few people. 
                I already have experience with dealing with those people from the previous semester 
                and through work and freelancing. <p>
            
            
                <p>I’m writing this when in week 6. So far, we are done with the project plan and the 
                preliminary research. So far it went well but it was quite a hassle with the group 
                as I learned not to depend on anyone. A few group members are just irresponsible 
                and don’t stick to deadlines. So, what I decided to do if the deadline has passed 
                to just work a bit more and do it myself. I don’t know if it’s the right way to do 
                it but gets the job done at least.<p>
